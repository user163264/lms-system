# Database Implementation Verification

## Overview

This document verifies that the changes made to align frontend and backend exercise type identifiers have been successfully implemented and tested in the database. We've successfully added examples of all exercise types to the database with the correct type identifiers and confirmed that the database structure supports the aligned type system.

## Database Verification Results

The following exercise types have been confirmed to work correctly in the database:

| Exercise Type | Status | Database ID | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| `fill_blank` | ✅ Working | 1 | Pre-existing type, no changes needed |
| `true_false` | ✅ Working | 2 | Pre-existing type, no changes needed |
| `multiple_choice` | ✅ Working | 3 | Pre-existing type, no changes needed |
| `matching_words` | ✅ Working | 4 | Renamed from `word_match` |
| `sentence_reordering` | ✅ Working | 5 | Renamed from `sentence_order` |
| `cloze_test` | ✅ Working | 6 | Renamed from `gap_text` |
| `word_scramble` | ✅ Working | 7 | Newly added type |
| `image_labeling` | ✅ Working | 8 | Newly added type |
| `long_answer` | ✅ Working | 9 | Renamed from `summary` |

## Database Structure Support

The current database structure uses JSON fields to store exercise-specific data, which provides the flexibility needed to support all exercise types. The structure is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE exercises (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    lesson_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES lessons(id),
    exercise_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    question TEXT NOT NULL,
    options JSON,
    correct_answer JSON NOT NULL,
    max_score INTEGER,
    grading_type VARCHAR
);
```

This structure allows:
- Exercise type to be stored as a string in the `exercise_type` field
- Exercise-specific data to be stored in the `options` JSON field
- Answers to be stored in the `correct_answer` JSON field

## Examples of Exercise Type Data

### Image Labeling (New Type)
```json
{
  "exercise_type": "image_labeling",
  "question": "Label the parts of the cell",
  "options": {
    "image_url": "https://example.com/cell.jpg",
    "labels": ["Nucleus", "Cell Membrane", "Mitochondrion"],
    "label_points": [
      {"id": "1", "x": 30, "y": 30},
      {"id": "2", "x": 50, "y": 60},
      {"id": "3", "x": 70, "y": 40}
    ]
  },
  "correct_answer": {
    "1": "Nucleus",
    "2": "Cell Membrane",
    "3": "Mitochondrion"
  }
}
```

### Word Scramble (New Type)
```json
{
  "exercise_type": "word_scramble",
  "question": "Unscramble the words to form a sentence",
  "options": {
    "sentence": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
  },
  "correct_answer": ["The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"]
}
```

### Matching Words (Renamed Type)
```json
{
  "exercise_type": "matching_words",
  "question": "Match the following words to their definitions",
  "options": {
    "items_a": ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"],
    "items_b": ["Red fruit", "Yellow fruit", "Red small fruit"]
  },
  "correct_answer": {"0": "0", "1": "1", "2": "2"}
}
```

## Verification Process

The verification process included:

1. Checking existing exercise types in the database
2. Adding new exercises with the aligned type identifiers
3. Confirming that all exercise types store data correctly
4. Verifying that exercise-specific data structures (e.g., label points for image labeling) can be stored in the JSON fields

## Conclusion

The database implementation successfully supports all the aligned exercise types. The flexible JSON structure allows for storing different data requirements for each exercise type while maintaining a consistent schema. This approach supports current exercise types and provides room for future expansion with minimal changes to the database structure.

Moving forward, all new exercises should use the aligned type identifiers to ensure consistency between the frontend and backend systems.
