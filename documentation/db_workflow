   ```
   Debug approach: Log all authentication attempts with IP addresses and failure reasons
   ```

3. **Add Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent submission flooding
   - Add debugging: Track rate limit hits

   ```
   Debug approach: Create dashboard showing rate-limited requests per hour
   ```

## Phase 3: Submission Processing

1. **Implement Queue System**
   - Set up message queue (RabbitMQ/SQS) for handling submissions
   - Add debugging: Queue monitoring

   ```
   Debug approach: Add instrumentation to track queue size and processing time
   ```

2. **Create Grading Service**
   - Develop service to process submissions from queue
   - Add debugging: Detailed grading logs

   ```
   Debug approach: Log each step of the grading process with input/output validation
   ```

3. **Implement Transaction Management**
   - Ensure atomic operations for submissions
   - Add debugging: Transaction failure alerts

   ```
   Debug approach: Create transaction wrapper that logs all steps and rolls back on failure
   ```

## Phase 4: Front-End Implementation

1. **Create Test-Taking Interface**
   - Implement responsive UI for taking tests
   - Add debugging: Client-side error tracking

   ```
   Debug approach: Implement detailed client-side logging and error boundary components
   ```

2. **Add Offline Support**
   - Implement local storage for answers
   - Add debugging: Sync conflict detection

   ```
   Debug approach: Log when local storage is used and when data is synchronized
   ```

3. **Implement Progressive Loading**
   - Load test content incrementally
   - Add debugging: Performance tracking

   ```
   Debug approach: Add performance markers to track component render and load times
   ```

## Phase 5: Error Handling & Recovery

1. **Implement Global Error Handling**
   - Create error boundaries and fallbacks
   - Add debugging: Centralized error collection

   ```
   Debug approach: Create a central error logging service with severity levels
   ```

2. **Add Submission Recovery**
   - Auto-save functionality and recovery options
   - Add debugging: Recovery attempt tracking

   ```
   Debug approach: Log all recovery attempts with success/failure status
   ```

3. **Create Admin Dashboard**
   - Develop monitoring tools for submission status
   - Add debugging: Real-time system health metrics

   ```
   Debug approach: Create health dashboard showing system status in real-time
   ```

## Phase 6: Testing & Optimization

1. **Implement Load Testing**
   - Create scripts to simulate 400+ concurrent users
   - Add debugging: Performance bottleneck detection

   ```
   Debug approach: Use profiling tools to identify slow code paths under load
   ```

2. **Optimize Database Queries**
   - Add indexes and refine queries
   - Add debugging: Query performance logging

   ```
   Debug approach: Add execution plan logging for slow queries
   ```

3. **Setup Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Configure alerts for system issues
   - Add debugging: Error rate notifications

   ```
   Debug approach: Set up alerts for unusual error patterns or rates
   ```

## Phase 7: Deployment & Production Readiness

1. **Setup CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automate testing and deployment
   - Add debugging: Deployment validation

   ```
   Debug approach: Add post-deployment smoke tests and rollback capability
   ```

2. **Implement Caching Layer**
   - Add Redis for active test sessions
   - Add debugging: Cache hit/miss logging

   ```
   Debug approach: Track cache efficiency metrics and invalidation events
   ```

3. **Create Backup Strategy**
   - Configure frequent backups during testing periods
   - Add debugging: Backup verification

   ```
   Debug approach: Log successful backups and periodically test restoration
   ```

## Key Debugging Techniques Throughout Implementation

1. **Structured Logging**
   - Implement consistent JSON logging across all services
   - Include correlation IDs to track requests through the system
   - Log contextual information (user ID, test ID, etc.)

2. **Telemetry & Metrics**
   - Track key performance indicators like submission time, processing time
   - Create dashboards for real-time visibility
   - Set up alerts on abnormal patterns

3. **Error Classification**
   - Categorize errors by type (validation, system, etc.)
   - Track error frequencies to prioritize fixes
   - Implement progressive error detail levels (user-friendly to detailed)

4. **Debugging Endpoints**
   - Create admin-only endpoints to check system state
   - Add ability to trace specific submissions through the system
   - Implement feature flags to enable/disable detailed debugging

5. **Client-side Debugging**
   - Add detailed logging for submission attempts
   - Create user feedback mechanisms for reporting issues
   - Implement session recording for reproducing problematic scenarios

## Database Schema Design

### Main Tables:
1. `students` - Student information
2. `tests` - Test configurations and metadata
3. `test_questions` - Questions associated with tests
4. `student_tests` - Assignment of tests to students
5. `submissions` - Test submission metadata
6. `submission_answers` - Individual answers within submissions
7. `scores` - Calculated scores for submissions

### Logging Tables:
1. `query_logs` - Database query performance tracking
2. `error_logs` - System error tracking
3. `auth_logs` - Authentication activity
4. `submission_logs` - Detailed submission activity
