# Conceptual Overview of the LMS PoC

We are building a **teacher-focused Learning Management System (LMS)** that **automates lesson creation and minimizes teacher workload** through AI-powered exercise generation.

## 🔍 Core Idea

* Teachers input lesson content → AI generates exercises automatically.
* Students complete exercises → LMS provides instant feedback & tracks progress.
* Teachers review results → Minimal manual grading.

## 🔍 Key Features

1. **AI-Generated Exercises** (fill-in-the-blanks, MCQs, comprehension, etc.).
2. **Student Dashboard** (gamified, progress tracking, mobile-friendly).
3. **Teacher Dashboard** (lesson templates, auto-exercise creation, progress tracking).
4. **FastAPI Backend + Next.js Frontend** hosted on AWS.
5. **Automated & Scalable** (minimal admin work, instant feedback, AI grading).

## 🔍 Why?

* **Addresses teacher shortages** by reducing workload.
* **Engages Gen Z students** with interactive, gamified learning.
* **Scalable & Simple** with future-proofing for analytics, lesson-sharing, and integrations.

## 🔍 MVP Focus

* **Basic AI exercise generation**
* **Student submission & tracking**
* **Teacher lesson management**
* **Cloud deployment (AWS EC2)** for testing.

This **PoC (Proof of Concept)** is a **foundation** for a fully automated **education platform** that makes learning **engaging for students** and **effortless for teachers**.
