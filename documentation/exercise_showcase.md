# Exercise Showcase Page

## Overview

The Exercise Showcase page is a comprehensive demonstration of all 10 exercise types available in the Spotvogel LMS. This page is designed to showcase the functionality of each exercise type in a single, accessible interface.

## URL Access

The showcase is accessible at:

```
http://13.42.249.90:3002/exercise-gallery
```

## Features

- Displays all 10 exercise types in a single page
- Provides example questions for each exercise type
- Allows users to interact with and submit answers for each exercise
- Shows feedback for submitted answers
- Uses the centralized API service architecture
- **NEW**: All exercise types are now clickable and link to their respective implementation pages
- **NEW**: Additional navigation links for accessing other exercise routes

## Exercise Types Included

1. **Multiple Choice**: Selection from predefined options
2. **True/False**: Binary decision exercises
3. **Fill in the Blank**: Complete sentences with missing words
4. **Short Answer**: Brief text responses
5. **Matching Words**: Connect related items
6. **Word Scramble**: Rearrange words to form a complete, meaningful sentence
7. **Sentence Reordering**: Place sentences in the correct sequence
8. **Image Labeling**: Identify and label parts of an image
9. **Long Answer**: Extended essay-style responses
10. **Cloze Test**: Fill in missing words using a word bank

## Implementation Notes

- Each exercise type is rendered using the shared `ExerciseRenderer` component
- Exercise data can be provided either as static examples or from the API
- The page uses the same styling and components as the regular exercise pages
- **NEW**: Dynamic routing using the Next.js App Router is now properly implemented
- **NEW**: Firewall has been configured to allow external access on port 3002

## Technical Details

- File path: `/frontend/app/exercise-gallery/page.tsx`
- Component architecture:
  ```
  ExerciseShowcase
  └── ExerciseRenderer
      └── Type-specific exercise component
  ```
- Local evaluation logic is implemented for immediate feedback
- **NEW**: Using App Router conventions with proper page.tsx structure
- **NEW**: Server configured to bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) for external access

## Database Population

To populate the database with exercise content:

1. Create a JSON file following the format in `test_import.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "lesson_id": 5,
     "exercises": [
       {
         "exercise_type": "fill_blank",
         "question": "Sample question with _______.",
         "correct_answer": ["answer"],
         "max_score": 1,
         "grading_type": "auto"
       }
       // Additional exercises...
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Use the `import_exercise.py` script to import the exercises:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/lms
   python import_exercise.py
   ```

3. The script connects to the PostgreSQL database and imports all exercises from the JSON file.

## Usage

This page serves as:

1. A demonstration for stakeholders and users
2. A testing ground for exercise functionality
3. A reference for developers implementing new exercise types
4. A publicly accessible showcase of the system's capabilities

## Maintenance

When updating exercise types or creating new ones, this page should be updated to include examples of any new functionality.

## Troubleshooting

If the exercise gallery is not accessible:

1. Verify the frontend service is running:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/lms
   ./start-frontend.sh
   ```

2. Ensure port 3002 is open in the firewall:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   sudo ufw allow 3002/tcp  # If not already allowed
   ```

3. Check for API connection issues in the browser console and verify the backend API is running.
