# Exercise Grading Status in Database

## Overview

This document analyzes the grading status of all exercise types in the database. Initially, some exercise types were missing the necessary grading information. We have since updated the database to ensure all exercise types have the correct grading values.

## Current Status

Based on the database query, here is the current status of grading information for each exercise type:

| Exercise Type | Count | Max Score | Grading Type | Status |
|--------------|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| `fill_blank` | 1 | 1 | auto | ✅ Complete |
| `true_false` | 1 | 1 | auto | ✅ Complete |
| `multiple_choice` | 1 | 1 | auto | ✅ Complete |
| `cloze_test` | 1 | 2 | auto | ✅ Complete |
| `matching_words` | 1 | 3 | auto | ✅ Complete |
| `sentence_reordering` | 1 | 1 | auto | ✅ Complete |
| `word_scramble` | 1 | 1 | auto | ✅ Complete |
| `image_labeling` | 1 | 1 | auto | ✅ Complete |
| `long_answer` | 1 | 5 | manual | ✅ Complete |

## Initial Issues

Initially, the newly added or renamed exercise types were missing their grading information:
- `max_score` was NULL
- `grading_type` was NULL

This occurred because when we added the sample exercises using our `check_db.py` script, we did not explicitly set these values, and the database did not apply default values.

## Implemented Solutions

We took the following actions to address the issue:

1. **Updated Existing Exercises**: We ran SQL update commands to set the proper `max_score` and `grading_type` values for all exercises:

```sql
-- Update cloze_test exercises
UPDATE exercises SET max_score = 2, grading_type = 'auto' WHERE exercise_type = 'cloze_test';

-- Update matching_words exercises
UPDATE exercises SET max_score = 3, grading_type = 'auto' WHERE exercise_type = 'matching_words';

-- Update sentence_reordering exercises
UPDATE exercises SET max_score = 1, grading_type = 'auto' WHERE exercise_type = 'sentence_reordering';

-- Update word_scramble exercises
UPDATE exercises SET max_score = 1, grading_type = 'auto' WHERE exercise_type = 'word_scramble';

-- Update image_labeling exercises
UPDATE exercises SET max_score = 1, grading_type = 'auto' WHERE exercise_type = 'image_labeling';

-- Update long_answer exercises
UPDATE exercises SET max_score = 5, grading_type = 'manual' WHERE exercise_type = 'long_answer';
```

2. **Added Database Defaults**: We modified the database schema to add default values for `max_score` and `grading_type` columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE exercises 
ALTER COLUMN max_score SET DEFAULT 1,
ALTER COLUMN grading_type SET DEFAULT 'auto';
```

## Exercise Type Grading Specifications

The following table specifies the correct grading information for each exercise type in the system:

| Exercise Type | Max Score | Grading Type | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| `fill_blank` | 1 | auto | Simple automatic grading |
| `true_false` | 1 | auto | Simple automatic grading |
| `multiple_choice` | 1 | auto | Simple automatic grading |
| `matching_words` | 3 | auto | Higher score due to complexity |
| `sentence_reordering` | 1 | auto | Simple automatic grading |
| `cloze_test` | 2 | auto | Medium complexity automatic grading |
| `word_scramble` | 1 | auto | Simple automatic grading |
| `image_labeling` | 1 | auto | Simple automatic grading |
| `long_answer` | 5 | manual | Higher score, requires manual review |

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Update Test Scripts**: The `add_test_exercises` function in the `check_db.py` script should explicitly include `max_score` and `grading_type` values when inserting test exercises.

2. **Verification**: Regularly check that all exercises have the proper grading information in the database.

3. **Documentation**: Keep this documentation updated when adding new exercise types or modifying existing ones.

## Conclusion

All exercise types now have the proper grading information in the database, with appropriate `max_score` and `grading_type` values for each type. Additionally, database defaults have been added to ensure that any new exercises will have sensible default values if not explicitly specified. This completes the alignment of frontend and backend exercise types, including their grading specifications.
