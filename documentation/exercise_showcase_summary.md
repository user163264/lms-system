# Exercise Showcase Fix: Key Takeaways

## Issues Resolved

1. **React Hydration Errors** - Fixed by using `suppressHydrationWarning`
2. **Component Loading Issues** - Resolved with direct imports instead of dynamic imports
3. **Client-Side Rendering Inconsistencies** - Addressed with improved client state management

## Recommended Implementation

The most stable implementation is the **direct-showcase** approach which:
- Uses direct imports of exercise components
- Implements client-side rendering with smooth transition states
- Avoids hydration errors with proper client detection

## URLs

- Production-ready version: http://13.42.249.90:3001/direct-showcase
- Original version (with fixes): http://13.42.249.90:3001/exercise-showcase

## Technical Root Causes

1. Browser extensions modifying DOM elements between server rendering and client hydration
2. Race conditions in dynamic imports causing loading issues
3. Inconsistent state management between server and client rendering
