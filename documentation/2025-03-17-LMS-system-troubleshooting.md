# LMS System Troubleshooting Overview
Date: March 17, 2025

## Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the troubleshooting steps taken to diagnose and fix issues in the Learning Management System (LMS). The work focused on fixing the database layer, checking service status, and analyzing frontend-backend connectivity.

## Database Layer Fixes

1. **Model.save() Method Fix**: 
   - Identified issues with the `save()` method in `models.py`
   - Implemented a fixed method that properly handles database connections
   - Added error handling for cases where the fetch_one method fails
   - Ensured the database connection is properly closed in a finally block

2. **Database Schema Investigation**:
   - Discovered a mismatch in the expected database schema
   - Found that the "answer_data" column was missing from the "exercises" table
   - Created test scripts to diagnose database issues

## Test Scripts Development

1. **Created test_db_layer.py**:
   - Implemented functions to test direct database operations
   - Added setup_database() function for test data creation
   - Implemented error handling and result reporting

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added a run_all_tests() function that captures results of individual tests
   - Implemented graceful error handling to prevent test suite failures
   - Added summary reporting of test outcomes

## Service Status Checks

1. **Backend Service**:
   - Found the backend service was running on port 8000
   - Identified an ImportError when attempting to run main.py: "attempted relative import with no known parent package"
   - Confirmed the service was running despite the error

2. **Frontend Service**:
   - Verified the frontend service was running on port 3000
   - Examined the frontend directory structure
   - Found a large dev.log file indicating active development

3. **Database Service**:
   - Confirmed the database service was operational
   - Checked schema structure and identified missing columns

## Frontend Route Analysis

1. **Exercise Routes**:
   - Located the primary exercise routes at `/exercises/[lessonId]`
   - Found the exercise-showcase page displaying various exercise types
   - Discovered 9 exercises were present in the database

2. **Component Structure**:
   - Identified various exercise components in the `/components/exercises/` directory
   - Found components for different exercise types: WordScramble, MultipleChoice, ShortAnswer, etc.
   - Located the ExerciseRenderer component for rendering different exercise types

3. **Navigation Structure**:
   - Found that the home page has links to the Student Dashboard and Teacher Dashboard
   - Identified that exercises are accessible through lesson pages

## Environment Configuration

1. **API Connectivity**:
   - Found that the frontend is configured to connect to the backend at `http://13.42.249.90/api`
   - The backend service uses relative imports that cause issues when run directly

## Conclusion

The LMS system has several functional components with some integration issues. The primary challenges were:
1. Database schema mismatches
2. Backend import errors
3. Frontend-backend connectivity issues

All services are operational, but fixes are needed for the backend import error and database schema to ensure full functionality.
