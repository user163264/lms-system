# Frontend Cleanup Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Removed Redundant Configuration Files
- Deleted redundant `next.config.ts` file
- Kept the comprehensive `next.config.js` configuration file

### 2. Organized Frontend Structure
- Created structured directory layout:
  - `app/components/common` - Shared UI components
  - `app/components/layout` - Layout components
  - `app/components/exercises` - Exercise components
  - `app/features/{auth,courses,dashboard,exercises,lessons}` - Feature-based organization
  - `app/tests` - Consolidated test directory
- Moved components to appropriate locations:
  - Relocated NavBar.tsx to `app/components/layout`
  - Consolidated multiple test/showcase directories into `app/tests`
  - Created a central test index page for better navigation

### 3. Improved Log Management
- Updated `.gitignore` to explicitly exclude log files
- Added specific log file patterns (frontend.log, dev.log, server.log)
- Verified no large log files in the repository

### 4. Component Standardization
- Created `ExerciseTypes.ts` with TypeScript interfaces
- Established consistent type system for exercise components
- Set up improved directory structure for components

### 5. Utility Function Organization
- Migrated utilities to app/utils directory
- Converted logger.js to TypeScript (logger.ts)
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces and types

## Next Steps

1. Continue migrating components to follow the new structure
2. Update import paths in components to reference the new locations
3. Implement consistent naming conventions across all components
4. Further consolidate duplicate exercise component implementations

The frontend is now better organized with a clear structure and standardized approach to components, particularly for exercises. The cleanup improves maintainability and makes it easier for developers to navigate the codebase.
