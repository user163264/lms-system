# Backend Structure Improvement Changelog

## 2023-08-20: Logging Standardization

### Overview
Implemented a comprehensive logging system with standardized configuration, rotation policies, and organization. This improves observability, maintenance, and troubleshooting across the application.

### Changes

1. **Centralized Logging Configuration**
   - Created a dedicated `config/logging_config.py` module with comprehensive configuration
   - Implemented environment variable-based configuration for flexibility
   - Standardized log formats and naming conventions

2. **Log Rotation Implementation**
   - Added support for both size-based and time-based log rotation
   - Configured automatic cleanup of old log files
   - Set reasonable defaults (10MB max size, 5 backup files)

3. **Dedicated Logs Directory**
   - Moved all logs to a central `logs/` directory
   - Created a comprehensive README with documentation
   - Implemented proper directory structure for different log types

4. **Specialized Loggers**
   - Created purpose-specific loggers (request, error, database)
   - Ensured consistent logging patterns across the application
   - Updated existing code to use the new logging system

5. **Git Integration**
   - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude log files from version control
   - Cleaned up existing log files from the repository
   - Ensured only the README is tracked in the logs directory

### Benefits

1. **Improved Observability**: Better insight into application behavior and issues
2. **Reduced Disk Usage**: Automatic rotation prevents logs from consuming too much space
3. **Organized Structure**: Logical organization makes finding specific logs easier
4. **Consistent Format**: Standardized logging format across all components
5. **Configuration Flexibility**: Environment variable configuration for different environments

## 2023-08-19: Backend Restructuring

### Overview
Restructured the backend to follow a domain-driven design approach with clear separation of concerns. This improves maintainability, scalability, and makes it easier for developers to understand the codebase.

### Changes

1. **Reorganized Utility Files**
   - Created `app/utils/` directory with modules for:
     - Authentication utilities (`auth.py`)
     - Logging utilities (`logging.py`) 
     - Pagination utilities (`pagination.py`)
     - Input validation utilities (`validation.py`)
   - Moved utility script `check_services.py` to `scripts/services/`

2. **Reorganized Models**
   - Split monolithic `models.py` into domain-specific modules:
     - `models/lesson.py`
     - `models/exercise.py`
     - `models/submission.py`
     - `models/user.py`
     - `models/course.py`
   - Enhanced models with proper relationships
   - Added timestamps to all models
   - Improved data types and constraints

3. **Reorganized CRUD Operations**
   - Split monolithic `crud.py` into domain-specific modules:
     - `crud/lesson.py`
     - `crud/exercise.py`
     - `crud/submission.py`
   - Implemented consistent patterns across all CRUD operations
   - Added logging to track database operations
   - Enhanced error handling

4. **Improved Schema Structure**
   - Organized schemas by domain
   - Implemented consistent patterns for schema inheritance:
     - Base schemas for common fields
     - Create schemas for creation requests
     - Update schemas for update requests
     - Response schemas for API responses

5. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Added comprehensive README with:
     - Project structure
     - Design principles
     - Key components
     - Getting started guide
   - Added docstrings to all functions and classes

6. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Consistent typing with Python type hints
   - Better error handling
   - Improved logging
   - Consistent naming conventions

### Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Code is organized logically by domain, making it easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Scalability**: Modular design allows for easier scaling and extension.
3. **Developer Experience**: Clear structure makes it easier for new developers to understand the codebase.
4. **Testing**: Domain-specific modules are easier to test in isolation.
5. **Performance**: Better error handling and logging improves troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

### Next Steps

1. Update API routes to use the new structure
2. Update services to leverage the improved models and CRUD operations
3. Enhance test coverage for the new structure
4. Document API endpoints comprehensively
