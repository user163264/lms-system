# Port Configuration Implementation

This document summarizes the changes implemented to improve port configuration management in the LMS system.

## Summary of Changes

The port configuration implementation addresses the issues identified in the "Port Configuration Analysis" section of the cleanup plan. The changes standardize how port configurations are managed, make them configurable via environment variables, and add automated handling for port conflicts.

## Files Created

1. **`lms/documentation/configuration/port_configuration.md`**
   - Comprehensive documentation on port configuration
   - Instructions for changing ports and resolving conflicts

2. **`lms/nginx/lms.conf`**
   - Proper Nginx configuration for a production environment
   - Routing rules for backend and frontend services
   - Instructions for using environment variables with Nginx

## Files Modified

1. **`lms/backend/app/config/settings.py`**
   - Added API_HOST and API_PORT settings
   - Added FRONTEND_HOST, FRONTEND_PORT, and FRONTEND_URL settings
   - Updated CORS_ORIGINS to use the frontend port setting

2. **`lms/backend/app/config/__init__.py`**
   - Exposed the new port-related settings

3. **`lms/backend/.env.example`**
   - Added port configuration environment variables
   - Added documentation for each setting

4. **`lms/scripts/start_backend.sh`**
   - Updated to use environment variables for host and port
   - Added port conflict detection and resolution
   - Added .env file loading
   - Improved error handling and logging

5. **`lms/start-frontend.sh`**
   - Updated to use environment variables for host and port
   - Added port conflict detection and resolution
   - Added .env file loading
   - Improved error handling and logging

6. **`lms/scripts/services/check/check_services.py`**
   - Updated SERVICE_CONFIG to use environment variables
   - Added helper functions for reading environment variables
   - Made service checks respect configured ports

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Environment Variable Configuration**
   - All ports can now be configured via environment variables
   - Standardized naming convention (LMS_DB_PORT, LMS_API_PORT, LMS_FRONTEND_PORT)
   - Default values maintained for backward compatibility

2. **Port Conflict Resolution**
   - Automatic detection of port conflicts
   - Dynamic selection of alternative ports
   - Clear logging of port changes

3. **Centralized Configuration**
   - All port settings managed in the central config module
   - Consistent access pattern throughout the codebase
   - Type-safe environment variable handling

4. **Nginx Configuration**
   - Proper reverse proxy setup for production
   - Clear routing rules for backend and frontend
   - Support for static file serving

5. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Clear explanation of default ports
   - Instructions for changing port configuration
   - Troubleshooting guidance for port conflicts

## Testing

To verify the port configuration changes:

1. Set custom port values in a .env file
   ```
   LMS_API_PORT=8001
   LMS_FRONTEND_PORT=3001
   ```

2. Start the services with the startup scripts
   ```
   ./scripts/start_backend.sh
   ./start-frontend.sh
   ```

3. Verify the services are running on the configured ports
   ```
   python scripts/services/check/check_services.py
   ```

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation significantly improves port configuration management, there are some additional enhancements that could be made in the future:

1. Add a command-line argument to startup scripts for overriding the port
2. Implement a systemd service file template that reads from the .env file
3. Add an integration test suite specifically for port configuration
4. Create a unified service management script that starts/stops all services
